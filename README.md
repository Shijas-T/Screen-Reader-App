# Screen-Reader-App
This app will read text from screen and store it.

About this App. :-

What this app do is it read Text from screen using Android Accessibility feature and stores it in Android shared preference.
All this happen in background.

Now where I reached is, I have Implemented Android Accessibility.
Storing that Text in Android shared preference is yet to Implement.
